            Recently, I read a few chapters about information architecture in Lisa Maria Martin's book Everyday
            Information Architecture.

            What I found most interesting was the LATCH framework which was developed by Saul Wurman. This framework basically says that any website can organize its content based on Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, and Hierarchy. I found this to be quite interesting as it gave me a new perspective when it comes to understanding a website's information architecture decisions. For example, it made me think about how Instagram used to arrange content in their feed based on time, but have now moved to a hierarchical system where some posts are assigned more "weight" and are thus displayed earlier.
